1. What This Script Does:
Flushing DNS:
Clears outdated records to ensure your DNS queries use the most current entries.

Releasing/Renewing IP Configuration:
Resets your network settings for a fresh lease.

2. TCP Adjustments:

Auto-Tuning: Ensures your TCP window is set to a level that balances throughput and latency.

Chimney Offload: Disabling this helps prevent certain offloading issues that might cause jitter.

Receive-Side Scaling (RSS): Enabled in some cases to improve performance on multi-core systems.

3. MTU Setting:
Manually sets the MTU for the network adapter to 1400. This value might be tweaked if youâ€™re still having issues (you can experiment between 1400 to 1472). Adjust the network interface name if yours differs from "Wi-Fi".

*Notes:
Admin Rights:
The script must be run as Administrator for the changes to take effect.
